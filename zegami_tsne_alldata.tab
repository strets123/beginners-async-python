Maria dei Miracoli, was the gateway to Rome for the pilgrim or Grand Tourist. The view is roughly from the top of the Porto del Popolo itself. The prototype is a small composition by Gaspar van Wittel (1652/3-1736) signed and dated 1683, of which several versions are known. This served as a source for Panini, Antonio Joli, Pietro Favris and Hendrick Frans van Lint. A69 is very close to Vanvitelli's prototype in the architecture, but there are considerable variations in the placing of the figures and their costumes, which are later in date and similar to those in Panini's views of the piazza. One of these, in the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art, Kansas City, is identical in every detail to A69 except for the clouds and sky. Panini and his studio produced pictures of the piazza at different times of the day for the tourist market.

Although the picture is much abraded, it has sufficient affinities with the mature work of Lo Scheggia to make the attribution convincing.

This act and its consequences as narrated by Livy (<i>Ab Urbe condita</i>I, 9-13) was seen by Renaissance commentators as leading to the institution of marriage in ancient Rome, thus the scene was appropriate for wedding celebrations.

A79 is a late work, probably of <i>c.</i>1470. It is a highly original painting, both as a nocturnal landscape and as a brilliantly structured composition. Uccello mapped out a grid on the panel's surface as a guide for his design, fixing a central vanishing point. The devices of the huntsmen's spears, the cut branches and logs and the area of water denote this coherent space, inhabited by the receding forms of men and animals. Uccello's approach is also highly decorative, with bright, clear colours set off against a dark background: the foliage of the trees was once picked out with gold, accentuating the precious, mosaic-like effect. Hunting was an aristocratic pastime with its own rituals (and the crescent moon, symbol of Diana, the chaste goddess of the hunt, appears in the horses' trappings) and the idea here of a hunt by night is playful or symbolic rather than realistic. A79 is a <i>spalliera</i>panel painted for a luxurious domestic setting, perhaps in Urbino or in Florence.

A105 was painted <i>c.</i>1550-51, when Bronzino, as court artist to Cosimo I, was working on a group of Medici family portraits.

Traditionally but erroneously referred to as a preparatory sketch for the fresco, A102 is probably by an artist of the late 16th century when there was a revival of interest in Florence in the art of Sarto.

It is very rare to find the subjects of the Crucifixion and Lamentation depicted in one scene, which makes for a highly charged devotional image. Christ on the Cross is flanked, unusually, by St Peter and St John the Evangelist and the body of Christ is mourned by women, with the Virgin Mary at his head and Mary Madgalen at his feet. A73 is one of a group of panel paintings by the hand of an artist traditionally known as 'Barna da Siena'; this master was a close follower of the great Sienese artist Simone Martini (<i>c.</i>1284-1344) and is sometimes thought to be Lippo Memmi or his brother Federico.

Attributions have since been proposed to Piazzetta; to Neapolitan or Spanish 17th-century artists; to Louis Finson; or to different French or Flemish followers of Caravaggio. The subject of pensive musicians was especially popular in the circles of Angelo Caroselli and of Michelangelo Cerquozzi. However, A113 appears to be northern Italian.

Bellucci's main source was the painting by Veronese for Ca' Pisani, Venice, now in the National Gallery. Traditionally A140 was assumed to have been painted in England, where Bellucci worked from 1716 to 1722. Some scholars have rightly argued it is stylistically incongruous for that period and have questioned or rejected the attribution. In fact, A140 is clearly an early work, probably for the portego or main reception room of a Venetian palace. Little is known of Bellucci's early career and patrons.

Fifteen appointments for Miss Keppel are recorded in Reynolds's sitter books between 22 May and 12 December 1782. The portrait cost 50 guineas.

The upper register contains the Nativity, with figures of the seven Virtues below. He made preliminary drawings, full-size oil-sketches and cartoons, from which Thomas Jervais (d. 1799) painted the glass. This is the sketch for the figure of <i>Charity</i>, which was based on an engraving of the antique statue of Niobe and for which the actress, Mrs Sheridan, served as the model.

Rubens produced a large number of oil-sketches as models for the artists and craftsmen who realised his designs. The most elaborate structure was the Portico of the Emperors, which included twelve over-life-size gilded stone statues of the Habsburg emperors. This sketch is a study for the statue of Maximilian I (1459-1519).

Commissioned by the Venetian state through the agency of Pietro Edwards on 21 May 1782, they were completed by 24 December 1782. A number of preparatory drawings for A149 are known, while Guardi and his studio made other versions, of which the most important is that at Upton House (National Trust). An elaborate temporary staircase and balcony was erected in front of the Scuola Grande di San Marco to accommodate the Pope, the Doge, the Patriarch of Venice and other dignitaries. Guardi elongated the proportions of the buildings and of the Colleoni statue to give greater verve and dramatic effect to the scene.

However, the far larger expanse of sky in that painting suggests that A146 was the prototype.

He was killed in action on 15 June 1780. He married at Gibraltar, Jane Majendie of Exeter on 16 May 1762. Six sittings are recorded for Captain and Mrs Pownall in December 1762.

The scene shows an inn, The Old Angle In (i.e. Old England), at the time of the General Election.

The musician stopping his ears in the window has been interrupted by the sounds from the street: a knife grinder, a dustman, a drummer, an itinerant oboe player, a mother holding a screaming baby and singing, while a child waves a rattle. The scene probably took place in St Martin's Lane, London, on a feast day, when the peal of the bells of St Martin's in the Fields would have added to the cacophony.

The sketch in the Ashmolean, which corresponds closely to the print, must be the model painted by Rubens for the engraver.

A Christian family is hiding a priest from a crowd of heathens and Druids, who have already caught another priest in the background. The painting is full of symbolic allusions, in keeping with contemporary High Anglican thinking: the priest recalls Christ and his disciples, the child with the fur loincloth John the Baptist and the older youth squeezing grapes evokes the Eucharist. It was one of Hunt's earliest Pre-Raphaelite paintings and caused controversy when exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1850.

He wrote to Combe in 1854 that he had begun a life-sized study of an Egyptian girl, but that the trials of heat and dust and the difficulty of persuading the model to pose, caused him to abandon the painting. He returned to it back in England in 1861 (Southampton Art Gallery) and at the same time painted this smaller version.

He made sketches of it, but did not complete this painting until 16 May 1864, retouching it in 1866. He was fascinated by the contrasts of natural and artificial light and by the 'Hogarthian humour' of the crowds. He introduced portraits of several friends and acquaintances, including Thomas Combe in a top hat on the extreme left, arm in arm with the artist himself; and Mrs Combe with Millais's father and brother and the artist Robert Braithwaite Martineau. The frame was designed by Hunt to combine emblems appropriate to a wedding and the arms of the royal families of Denmark and England.

He later made several versions of the composition, of which this is the last. It was painted during his third visit to Jerusalem and intended for the inaugural exhibition at the Grosvenor Galleries in 1877. Hunt later described the view down the valley and of the 'flanking hills reaching to 'Gebel el Cowis', the Hill of Precipitation.... On the great lower plain stretched the patchwork slope of Tabor, continuing to the hills of Gilboa and Dothan and these branched out into the swelling heights of Samaria, as well as the extended range of Carmel, bounding on south Jezreel, Megiddo and the lowland'.

His eventual painting, which is not the sermon he had at first envisaged, is much less rhetorical. The subject is from Genesis, 8: 11: in order to ascertain whether the flood had abated, Noah sent out a dove, which returned with a sprig of olive. Here, the daughters of Noah hold the dove and the olive sprig. Although the background is untypically dark, the details are painted with astonishing fidelity and Ruskin so admired the work that he tried to buy it when it was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1851. It had already been sold to Combe in March. Its new owner hung it on one side of Holman Hunt's <i>The Converted British Family</i>, with Collins's <i>Convent Thoughts</i>on the other. The frame is original and includes elements appropriate to the painting: olive leaves and fruit.

His wife presided over a salon at her home in Walton Street and it was there that this portrait and the companion by Collins of William Bennett, were painted. This painting was made in four sittings of two hours each. The coat of arms is that granted to Shakespeare's friend, John Combe in 1584. He was no relation of Thomas Combe.

The source for the portraits is a 15th-century Tuscan manuscript in which the subjects are depicted separately. The unknown artist, whose style is close to Bartolomeo Veneto, may have known these or copies of them.

The book, <i>Ashmole of the Garter</i>, represents his <i>Institution, Laws and Ceremonies of the most Noble Order of the Garter</i>(1672). The medals (<i>Praemia honoraria</i>), carefully depicted, no doubt at Ashmole's request, are a filigree chain and portrait medallion of Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg (worn by the sitter); a portrait medal of Karl Ludwig of Bavaria; the George of the Order of the Garter which had belonged to Thomas Howard, 2nd Earl of Arundel and which was given to Ashmole by the Earl Marshal; and another chain and medal, given by the King of Denmark. It is likely that the portrait was painted in 1681-2 for presentation to the new museum in Oxford. The spectacular frame was carved by Grinling Gibbons (1648-1720), for whom Ashmole cast a horoscope in 1682. It is surmounted by Ashmole's arms and his motto, <i>EX UNO OMNIA</i>('all things come from one').

The original composition, known from a drawing in the Ashmolean, showed the boy desolate over the grave of his mother. The landscape was begun in the summer of 1856 in the old churchyard at Chingford, Essex. Around 1862, Hughes altered the background and added the figure of the sister, for which the artist's wife, Tryphena, posed. The detail is used to reinforce the pathos of the subject, so that the ephemeral nature of spider's webs, dew drops, dog roses and dandelion seeds all emphasise the theme of transience. The boy's loss is retold in the lamb separated from its mother by the barrier of the tomb.

At Christ's feet are the prostrate figures of Mary and Martha. The setting of rocky landscape, distant architecture and delicate plants, is characteristic of feast scenes such as this from the 13th century on. The painting style may be compared with Palaeologan work such as the icon of the same subject in the Hermitage, St Petersburg where, however, the figures are less elongated and the so-called Cardinal Bessarion's reliquary.

The subject is from Virgil's <i>Aeneid</i>VII, 483-99: Ascanius, hunting in Latium with his companions, becomes the instrument of the Fury Allecto who is sent by Juno to provoke war. Allecto, here evoked by the wind bending the trees in an impending storm, directs Ascanius's uncertain aim to wound mortally the tame stag of Silvia, the daughter of Tyrrheus, ranger to the King of the Latins; war ensues. The earlier pendant takes as its starting point Virgil's description of Dido and Aeneas leaving for the hunt (IV, 136-142) but the composition encapsulates other moments in the narrative, including Dido showing Carthage to Aeneas and Dido accusing Aeneas of betrayal. Both pictures explore moments of peacefulness and uncertainty before violence and sorrow and both are concerned with Aeneas's heir, Ascanius, for whose future Aeneas abandoned Dido. Each includes prominent reference to the Colonna family emblems of columns. The pendants remained together until 1801.

Weldon, 1927	WA1927.3	Paris 1999-2000, under no. 35	Chardin's studies of kitchen utensils fall roughly into the years 1728-34; before that, he concentrated on still life with game. He may have turned to kitchen subjects on his admission to the Academy in 1728 to distinguish himself from artists such as Desportes and Oudrey who specialised in game and hunting pieces. A388 was probably painted <i>c.</i>1733-34 when Chardin was turning to genre scenes. Two other versions are known.

The subject, taken from the Book of Ruth, was popular in Rembrandt's circle and Rembrandt's influence is evident in this painting. From the evidence of a preparatory drawing in Bremen, it seems likely that part of the canvas has been cut off on the right.

The focal point in all is the tower of Dedham church, which Constable described as 'a characteristic feature of the Vale'. He made a number of drawings and oil sketches of this particular view in 1812-13, perhaps intending to work them up into a larger exhibition picture, which, however, he never painted. One of these sketches (V&A, London) was the basis for David Lucas's mezzotint, <i>Summer Morning</i>, published in <i>English Landscape Scenery</i>in 1831.

According to a note by the artist, it was begun in watercolour and finished with colours ground in turpentine used with copal varnish. The subject was developed through a series of preparatory drawings and reached its final form in this painting, one of Richmond's most successful subject paintings before he turned exclusively to portraiture. It was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1830.

The figure of the miser had always been a stock character in literature, but was rarely represented in art before the 17th century. Dupont's boldly painted figure clutching his bag of gold coins probably dates from <i>c.</i>1780. There is a second version of the painting in Hereford Art Gallery.

The sketch was probably made by one of Corot's French contemporaries working in Italy in the early 19th century. Olevano, a hill town east of Rome, was a popular site for foreign artists.

During his visits to Italy, Sargent sought relief from painting portraits and turned to landscapes, both in oils and watercolours. The artist described this as 'a study of a magnificent curved staircase and balustrade, leading to a grand fa&ccedil;ade that would reduce a millionaire to a worm'. He later used the study for the background to a portrait of Charles E. Eliot, President of Harvard University (Harvard).

Dating from <i>c.</i>1505, A420 may have been one of a series described by Vasari as painted for Francesco del Pugliese. Two other panels of <i>The Hunt</i>and <i>The Return from the Hunt</i>, now in the Metropolitan Museum, New York, are thematically related but seem to have been painted in the 1490s. All three are concerned with the history of early man, inspired by passages from Book 5 of <i>De Rerum Natura</i>by Lucretius (98-<i>c.</i>55BC), who traces the origins of life on earth and the birth of community life, emphasising the role of fire as a catalyst for change. The New York pendants vividly depict a primitive world, while A420 could have been made for a different patron, taking up particular themes relating to more advanced stages of human life. Piero painted a poetic interpretation of the classical source, with idiosyncratic details of hybrid beasts added at a late stage. The masterly rendition of the fire and distant landscape place him in the forefront of the development of landscape painting.

He later prefers to satisfy his political ambition rather than fulfil his private obligations. This painting was probably made in Paris in 1827 and was inspired not only by the contemporary vogue for Scott's novel, but by the production of Victor Hugo's new play, with scenery and costumes designed by Delacroix.

This is one of the smallest and most summary of the series, rapidly painted with a full brush and signed in pencil.

The spotted, lively handling of paint and choice of subject in this little painting are marked by the influence of Eug&egrave;ne Isabey with whom Hervier studied. Hervier's manner is, however, crisper than Isabey's. He handled paint and watercolour with an easy virtuosity and attracted notable support from Gautier, Corot and the Goncourt brothers among others, but had little commercial success.

His landscapes recall the work of C&eacute;zanne and Gauguin. At an early stage, he became known as a painter who was able to give his compositions a clear structure, create forms and evoke emotions through shape and colour. In this case, as in other landscapes painted shortly after the First World War, he confined the architecture to the background, drawing a sharp contrast with the trees and abbreviated figures in the foreground.

These objects can be found in different combinations in the artist's work from 1655 onwards. A similar still life in a private collection, dated 1657, may be contemporary. The silver wine-jar reflecting the artist at work wearing a hat is seen in a number of still lifes, including a particularly sumptuous example in The Mauritshuis in The Hague. It has been noted that the pitcher appears in all these works in exactly the same position, suggesting that the artist did not own this expensive vessel but relied upon a drawing as a model for each of these works. Unlike a normal reflection which reverses the image, van Beyeren's image on the jar shows an artist painting with his right hand, ie. a reflection of a left-handed artist. It may be that van Beyeren was left-handed but it may also be that he improvised his reflection without troubling to reverse the image.

His work seems to have been influenced by the Bosschaert school but with an added naturalism in the arrangement of the flowers. The glass container in this painting was a favourite accessory. It appears first in a work of 1627 and for the last time in a flower piece of 1639 (Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam).

He used a variety of blooms, painting them carefully and separately in a central arrangement. The general design of this still life is similar to a flower piece, dated 1609, in the Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna. The two paintings are probably contemporary.

This painting can be dated to about 1636.

This tendency, already evident in this painting of 1642, continued through the remainder of his life. The silver-handled knife first appeared in paintings of the early 1630s and seems to have disappeared shortly after this picture was painted.

The simple presentation of these modest themes and the delicacy of his touch seem out of touch with the taste in Holland at this time for more elegant and decorative still-life compositions.

By 1610, he had settled in Delft where he spent the rest of his life. He is one of the earliest painters of still life. A kitchen subject like this derives from the kitchen scenes of Joachim Beuckelaer and Pieter Aertsen but without the figures which feature in their work. The painting is chiefly an exercise in depicting metallic surfaces and effects of reflected light and was probably intended to hang in the kitchen of a substantial household.

Confusion between the work and signatures of the different members of the family has caused the work of the grandson to become submerged in misattributions.

None of Mignon's paintings are dated but it is generally accepted that his art became harder and his pigment more opaque in the years after he left de Heem's studio.

From her studio in Amsterdam, she painted a long succession of flower paintings, several fruit pieces and a number of 'forest floors' of which this is a relatively early example. The type was invented by Otto Marseus van Shrieck in about 1650 and imitated by Ruysch. A number of details in the composition have been inspired by pictures of this kind by de Heem, Mignon and Willem van Aelst.

Apart from this bouquet, only two other still-life paintings by him are known. The details of the flowers are realistically painted in the smooth 'fine manner' of Dou. The <i>trompe-l'oeil</i>frame adds an additional element of illusionism to the effect. The smooth handling suggests a relatively early date, perhaps in the 1670s.

The hard, brittle translucency of the drinking glasses which appear in many of van de Velde's still-life compositions is clearly inspired by the Haarlem painter, Willem Claesz. Heda. The accessories in this still life, which include a clay pipe, a glass of beer, a bowl of burning charcoal, playing cards and a piece of chalk, can be found in the work of Jan Jansz. Treck, a painter from Amsterdam whose work would have become familiar to van de Velde after he had settled in Amsterdam.

The same pewter dish (or one very similar) appears in works extending across the artist's career while the pasglas is found in works dating from 1641 onwards. The details refer to the pleasures of the public house: smoking, drinking and playing cards. The chalk would have been used by the card-players to chalk up the score.

This one includes a Wan-li porcelain dish of strawberries, a silver spoon, cherries and a glass fashioned in the Venetian manner. Paintings combining glasses of wine with fruit seem to have been a subject which he took up in the last seven or eight years of his career. These are more colourful than his previous work and were perhaps painted in response to the growing popularity of Jan Davidsz. de Heem's work.

Of all his known still-life paintings, this one is closest to the work of his first teacher, Cornelis Kick but there are also echoes of the work of Jan Davidsz. de Heem in the arrangement of small branches and flowers round the central motif. This indicates a fairly early date, about 1670, in the artist's career.

This painting has been dated to the artist's early years in London. Twisting and complex, the composition is pulled into place by the manipulation of light and colour.

About five paintings, mostly scenes of daily life, have been identified, one of which is dated 1663. The attribution of this still life is based on an inscription on the back of the panel but it is supported by comparison with details of his known work. The combination of the glass, brass-mounted book, recorder, crab, prawns, insects, butterfly, moth and laurel wreath is peculiar and must once have had a particular meaning.

He sometimes showed them out of doors, usually on a beach, and sometimes indoors on a table before a window which opens onto a fish market on a beach, or as here before a closed window. He painted fish paintings throughout his career. This one is difficult to date but there are similar still-life paintings of fish in the Staatliche Museen, Berlin (dated 1655) and in the Akademie der bildenden K&uuml;nste, Vienna (dated 1666).

Flowers often appear in his female portraits and in his paintings of game but still-life paintings of flowers by him are rare. The withered leaves do not appear in his work before the 1670s but are common in his later work. A date of about 1680 is suggested by the dark background, the form of the ledge and by the out-of-doors setting in which Weenix placed all his still lifes after <i>c.</i>1680.

Eeckhout appears to have been a pupil of Rembrandt in the later 1630s. This painting has been dated to the early 1660s, several years before Eeckhout painted a second version of this theme, now in the Louvre.

Together with three other surviving panels of a similar shape, this may have formed part of the predella of an altar-piece, perhaps of the 1390s. The other panels illustrate the saint's birth; his mother foretelling her son's future fame; and a miracle of the saint. Martino based his style on that of his celebrated master Altichiero, who favoured architecturally complex settings and lively narrative detail.

His sister stayed to watch while Pharaoh's daughter came to the river with her maidens and found the child (Exodus 2: 2-4). A791 is striking for its emotional intensity, with the focus on Moses's grief-stricken parents. The joyful scene of the finding of Moses was a popular one, whereas this subject is far less common (Poussin earlier treated it <i>c.</i>1627). Painted in 1654 for Jacques Stella, A791 was greatly admired by contemporaries for the artist's learned treatment of the subject, his skill in painting reflections and the beauty of the landscape. Pharoah's city is based on Pirro Ligorio's reconstruction of some of the most famous buildings of ancient Rome. A sphinx accompanied by a river-god and cornucopia identifies the Nile. Different explanations, based on Poussin's antiquarian interests and wide-ranging visual references, have been proposed for the significance of the pipes of Pan that hang from a tree behind this group. Two painted copies are recorded in the 17th century; other copies and variations are known (including a tapestry version of the right side) and three engraved versions were made, the first by Stella's niece, Claudine Bouzonnet Stella, in 1672.

The village consisted only of a customs house and a fisherman's hut, and Richmond lodged in the latter for two weeks, in order to witness the dawn coming up over the sea. This small panel shows the influence of Giovanni Costa, whom Richmond had met in Rome in 1866, and is one of Richmond's few seascapes.

She is absorbed in her task, calm and detached. Pissarro has concentrated on her face and the curling ironwork of the balcony, in heavily worked strokes of gentle colours, to create a mood of intimacy and hard work.

Between 7 May and 20 July 1897, Camille stayed there while Lucien was convalescing from a stroke. He made several paintings of the front and the back of the house. Here, Esther and Orovida play in the front garden. The painting is unfinished, especially in the foreground.

He was especially fond of autumn. He painted this view of the orchard repeatedly, altering the viewpoint and even the size and shapes of trees and seeking to convey the interaction of season, air and space within a limited subject matter. Here, the green and brown vegetation dissolves into a hazy grey horizon.

Veronese's interest in strong, broadly-handled forms and in exploring a range of textures, is characteristic. An early work intended for a private client, A863 probably dates from the early 1550s, soon after the artist moved from Verona to Venice.

This distinctive Venetian genre of poetic or fantasy portraits derives from Giorgione, and Tiepolo (celebrated as a latter-day Veronese) often looked to 16th-century Venetian art. Such images of beautiful women are often categorised as courtesans. Exotic birds are common in Tiepolo's work and here the macaw provides a colourful and witty motif. The cameo portrait shows one of the Caesars, possibly Augustus. Lorenzo Tiepolo made a pastel copy of A876 (National Gallery of Art, Washington), together with a pendant showing a woman in a fur wrap (<i>Allegory of Winter</i>, Kress Collection, El Paso Museum) which may record a lost oil painting.

Il Cerano by contrast was indebted to northern mannerist artists and treated religious subjects, with a disturbing intensity. If A887 is by Cerano, it must be a very early work. A small <i>Visitation</i>by Cerano (Mus&eacute;e des Beaux Arts, Dijon) also on copper, which is certainly close in the handling of draperies and physiognomy, may be a pendant and both pictures would date from <i>c.</i>1598-1600.

The primrose and harebells in the foreground and the ewe and two lambs on the ridge, herald the arrival of spring, though the trees are still bare, their branches picked out in sharp detail against the blue sky. The microscopic detail epitomises the Pre-Raphaelite approach to landscape painting, which sacrificed perspective to careful finish.

Paintings by Ferdinando are rare. Three family members are shown in the foreground, probably Ferdinando, his brother Francesco (1659-1739) and eldest son Alessandro (1686-1748). Accompanied by allegorical figures on the left including History and Painting, they present their plans to a ruler, represented by an enthroned female flanked by a warrior and by an allegory of abundance, with three crowned lions above pyramids, signifying three dukedoms. This ruling house is also represented by three framed male portraits of the late 17th century, accompanied respectively by Justice, Prudence and Peace. The horned river god on the right, with numerous putti bearing urns of water, is the River Po. The Bibiena worked for the Farnese family at Parma in the 1690s; however the regal family cannot be conclusively identified as the Farnese and may well be a German or Austrian house.

For his treatise on the advantages of Virtue over Pleasure he commissioned an allegory of <i>The Choice of Hercules</i>from Paolo de' Matteis. A talented pupil of Luca Giordano, de Matteis had studied in Rome and worked in France: his graceful classicism earned him high-ranking patronage. Annibale Carracci's <i>Choice of Hercules</i>in the Palazzo Farnese was a source for the composition. Shaftesbury provided detailed instructions for the attitudes and expressions of the figures. Hercules must choose between the hedonistic life exemplified by Pleasure, or Vice, and the rocky path of Virtue. Completed by March 1712, the picture was probably framed in a plain dark moulding; the fine mid 18th-century rococo frame, perhaps designed by the architect Henry Flitcroft (1697-1769), was given to A1116 by the fourth Earl. An oil-sketch is now in Munich; a smaller, autograph version was commissioned for Shaftesbury's friend, Sir John Cropley (now Leeds City Art Gallery). A1116 was engraved by Simon Gribelin.

Different identifications have been proposed for the aristocratic sitter, including that of Paolo Capranica, related to the Della Valle family, or a member of the Palma di Cesnola family, because their motto <i>Oppraesa Resurgam</i>appears on a scroll across a palm tree in the table inlay. The view of an imaginary landscape with a classically-draped figure leaning on a mannerist balcony gives the portrait an enigmatic air.

These qualities are represented in this landscape. It remains unclear if the houses and the trees visible are at the coast or near a lake. This is chiefly a study of atmosphere, charged with light, which evokes a sense of space without any identifiable detail.

He holds up a coin to buy a glass of gin from the woman seated opposite. The distillery - probably an illegal still - appears in the background in another room.

King Charles follows, carrying the orb and sceptre, walking beneath a canopy held by four attendants. There are over fifty figures in the procession. As the project for the tapestries was not taken any further, this sketch provides important evidence of what van Dyck intended.

The son of a painter, he was powerfully influenced by Frans Hals in his early career. This exceptionally important and beautiful portrait was probably painted just after 1640, when Verspronck was at the height of his powers. Although her indentity is unknown, the sitter's jewels and costume, with its splendid 'millstone' ruff, testify to her high social standing. Verspronck's calm realism and refined technique are evident in this dignified formal portrait, which is also endowed with great character and vitality.

WA2013.13		This carefully structured landscape, based on the Roman Campagna, provides a setting for a scene of nymphs and satyrs dancing and making music. Bril collaborated with figure painters and here the figures are probably by Pietro Paolo Bonzi (<i>c.</i> 1576-1636)._x000D_ <br /><br />_x000D_ Bril settled in Rome in about 1615. This is a late work influenced by the work of Annibale Carracci whose landscapes are similarly arranged like large stage sets with small foreground figures. The painting does not have a specific theme but shows nymphs and satyrs dancing and music making in an imaginary setting.

WA2013.14		This boldly executed painting is probably an oil-sketch made from the life as a study of physiognomy and expression. Although the man's gaze and the warm lighting suggest that Guercino had in mind a figure of a saint or a prophet, it is not connected with a final painting, nor is it a fragment of a finished work. The freedom of handling suggests a dating of <i>c.</i> 1619-20. A copy is in the Hermitage, St Petersburg.
